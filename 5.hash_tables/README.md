# Hash Tables

## Dictionaries, Objects, Maps

Different languages have different names for them.

## Collisions

Depending on the size of the hash tables, more often than not, there will be collisions.

A collision means that 2 elements will occupy the same space/reference in memory.

### How to solve collisions

You can use _Linked Lists_ to avoid collisions in hash maps.

Potentially any data structure will help, but there's also the downside of adding extra complexity where it is not needed.

- Specially for small hash tables.

### How do collisions affect us if we know how to solve this issue?

Because [in Big O that makes our worst cases O(n)](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/).
