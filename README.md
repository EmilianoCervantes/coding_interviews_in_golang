# Data Structures and algorithms in Go

## Why go?

I feel there's plenty of resources with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python; just mentioned some of the most popular languages out there.

And all of them have accumulated over the years a ton of courses, blog posts, videos regarding algorithms using them.

Go is not an uncommon language, it has been around since 2012, but has only gained popularity in the last 5~7 years (as I'm writing this in 2024). In essence we can say it is a pretty young programming language.

### Goal

The goal here is to code algorithms in Go an be able to share the results for future Gophers.

Let anyone that checks this repo go beyond learning Go and see what it can do (and hopefully I also do it the best way possible).

## Knowledge and Exercises

All the knowledge obviously didn't come from my head.

This is knowledge from college, colleagues during my professional journey, courses, and more.

So don't take this as my own (except for the solutions, which I did by myself).

### I encourage you to

Search through the Internet for books, courses and more so you can have a solid basis about all of these topics.

Books:

1. Clean Code
2. Cracking the Coding Interview
3. System Design Interview Part 1 and 2 By Alex Xu
4. Programming Interview Exposed
5. Algorithm Design Manual
6. Elements of Programming Interviews
7. Coding Interview Questions

#### Recommendations from interviewers

1. Visit [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) for practice. 
2. Project Euler - If you’ve been out of practice, complete up to problem 60 or so. You should be prompted to build useful libraries, which will help give practical experience for interview like problems. Don’t cheat or take shortcuts.
3. Watch [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/9-JWIJOTbGA) to see a demonstration of the Online Assessment platform and to hear tips and tricks from SDE's at Amazon. This video is approximately 45 minutes and was built as part of a virtual career fair. 

## Disclaimer

I'm trying my best. If there's anything you see can be improved, feel free to contribute.

What I'll try to do (whenever possible) is add alternatives to problems/solutions.
