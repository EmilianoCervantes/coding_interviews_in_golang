# Arrays

Even if you are new to coding, you should have familiarity with arrays.

Arrays are data structures that store values in a specific sequential order.

Each item has a position accessed via a number, the first starting at position/index 0.

Ex:

1. Array item at position 4.
2. Array item at position 21.
3. Array item at position 38064.
4. Array item at position _n_.

## Representation

When talking about arrays, most of the time you'll see them represented like this:

### Array of fruits

```
["apple", "banana", "watermelon", "lime"]
```

Fruits at position 0 = `fruits[0]` is `apple`


### Array of pets

```
["dogs", "cats", "parrots", "rabbits", "fish"]
```

Pets at position 2 = `pets[0]` is `parrots`
